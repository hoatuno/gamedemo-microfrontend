vue-2048
==========

This is a clone of [2048-react](https://github.com/IvanVergiliev/2048-react).What I do is re-implementing it using [Vue 3.x](https://cn.vuejs.org/),[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/)
and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).
**Here is the [living demo](https://pengfu.github.io/vue-2048/)**

### Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Run the dev server with hot reload at localhost:3000

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
yarn build
```
